  **Site translation:** Crowdsourced translations efforts are already underway via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/the-new-oil). If you speak another language, we would love your help translating the site. If the language you speak isn't listed, please [contact us](/links#contact) so that we can add it.

  **Mac Mini** Having a budget-model desktop Apple device would help us with testing, reviewing, and troubleshooting various tools and techniques for the website, most notably recommended settings. In the past we were able to run MacOS in a virtual machine, however Apple is making this increasingly difficult to the point where it is no longer possible for us.
