# Identity Theft Protection

Identity theft is one of the most common causes of anxiety in our digital age. In [2023](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/doj-identity-theft-victims-report-2023-10) alone, almost 24 million Americans had their identities stolen, totaling $16.4 billion in damages. Nearly a quarter of US residents have experienced identity theft at some point in their lives. I can only assume from anecdotal evidence that this doesn't include simpler forms of the crime that most people don't think of as "identity theft," like having a credit card number stolen.

Thankfully, **protecting yourself from most common avenues of identity theft is surprisingly easy.** The following pages on this website directly address common identity-theft-related issues and implementing the advice on these pages will dramatically reduce your risk.

**Note**: the advice on these pages will not stop a dedicated and well-resourced attacker, but it will make you a difficult enough target that most attackers will simply move on to an easier payday. If you have a significantly large amount of wealth and assets, you may need additional protections. I recommend talking to your lawyer and doing additional research in this case.
